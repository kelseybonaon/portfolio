    <!-- EDUCATION SECTION -->
    <section id="education" class="section fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-title">Education</h2>
      <p>
        This section highlights my academic background and the institutions that
        helped shape my knowledge. My educational journey began at Santa Rita
        College and Dominican School, two establishments that were crucial in
        shaping my academic foundation, morals, and perspective on education. I
        learned discipline, curiosity, and the importance of striving for
        excellence no matter how challenging the path may be from these schools.
        In addition to the lessons I've learned in school, my learning path has
        always focused on understanding my surroundings and discovering who I
        am. Every subject I studied, every challenge I faced, and every success
        I attained contributed to my growth. I believe that education is a
        lifetime commitment—a commitment to always learn, grow, and become a
        better version of myself every day.

    <!-- EXPERIENCE SECTION -->
    <section id="experience" class="section fade-in">
      <h2 class="section-title">Experience</h2>
      <p>
        My work experience, projects, and activities that contributed to my
        personal development. "Instead of teamwork, a lot of my development has
        come from innumerable moments of trial and error—trying new things,
        failing, fixing, and trying again. These experiences taught me patience,
        resilience, and the importance of persevering even when the answer isn't
        immediately obvious. Every setback turned into a lesson, and every
        accomplishment into a reminder that with hard work, progress is
        achievable. Through these experiences, I learned how to adapt, stay
        persistent, and trust the process of getting better over time."

        push me to step out of my comfort zone, challenge my limits, and stay
        focused on the journey toward becoming someone capable of making
        meaningful contributions. My goals represent the future I aspire to
        build for myself. I want to continue improving my skills, gaining
        experience, and finding confidence in my craft. One of my biggest dreams
        is to create something special—something uniquely mine—that I can share
        with others. Whether it's a project, a story, or a creative work, I want

        weaknesses, and stay committed to steady improvement. By focusing on
        consistency, discipline, and clarity, I'm building the foundations I
        need to excel in the things I care about. Every day is a chance to learn
        something new, refine my skills, and move a little closer to becoming
        the person I want to be." "My current focus is on strengthening the

        beginning—Art, the fascinating process of making video games, and the
        sincere encouragement of the people around me," the statement reads.
        "Art showed me how powerful expression can be, and video games opened my
        eyes to the incredible worlds people can build through imagination and
        effort, and the support from the people close to me gave me the
        confidence to follow this path," the statement reads.
